									<p align="center">An unique experience.Amazing and friendly serving.I can’t describe in words how good the food is at Musiu.The drinks are amazing too.Besides being the only restaurant in Timisoara chosen to be part of an amazing French project, it has a good reputation.I have never heard a single person saying they didn’t enjoy Musiu’s food.I have traveled all around the country and I have never tasted such a good food.Clean,cozy,beautifully designed and amazing are the words that come in my mind whenever I think about Musiu.I highly recommend this restaurant></p></div><br>

								   <p align="center">We did a food tasting there and we were surprised by how the good everything tastes. The pasta is just ah-mazing! We had the pesto one with haloumi cheese and the one with fine cheese. The honey and almond wings are also really good and the appetizer, pork pate with cranberries was just different. Also the server was really communicative and smiley which made our experience really nice. Will definitely come back and also recommend this place.
Good job!</p></div><br>

								   <p align="center">It is one of my favorite restaurants in Timisoara. It is sooo cozy and has cool, relaxing music like jazz. The restaurant is actually located in a house. The food here is really good, amazing flavor. I tried several types of the pasta they make - excellent. They have a wide range of good drinks. It is a place where you can feel just like home. The place also has a garden and in the summer, you can come and see movies in the garden while enjoying a good glass of wine and a lovely dinner. The prices are a bit high, but you cannot put a price of fine dining.</p></div><br>
